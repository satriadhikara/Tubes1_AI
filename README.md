# Solution Search for Diagonal Magic Cube with Local Search

This repository contains a program to find solutions for a **Diagonal Magic Cube** using various *Local Search* methods. Built with *React.js* and *TypeScript*, this interactive application allows users to experiment with different algorithms to achieve a solution. Implemented algorithms include *Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing*, *Simulated Annealing*, *Random Restart Hill Climbing*, *Stochastic Hill Climbing*, and *Genetic Algorithm*, which are used to find optimal or near-optimal configurations for the diagonal magic cube.

## Description

A Diagonal Magic Cube is a variant of a magic cube in which every diagonal has the same sum. This program focuses on finding a solution to the diagonal magic cube problem using *Local Search* methods, which efficiently explore the large solution space to find configurations that meet the cube's requirements.
